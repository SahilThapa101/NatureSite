	<p>
		The Earth's atmosphere is a key factor in sustaining the ecosystem.
		The thin layer of gases that envelops the Earth is held in place by gravity. 
		Air is mostly nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor, with much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide, argon, etc. 
		The atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude. 
		The ozone layer plays an important role in depleting the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. 
		As DNA is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. 
		The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.
		Terrestrial weather occurs almost exclusively in the lower part of the atmosphere, and serves as a convective system for redistributing heat.[25] Ocean currents are another important factor in determining climate, particularly the major underwater thermohaline circulation which distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions. These currents help to moderate the differences in temperature between winter and summer in the temperate zones. Also, without the redistributions of heat energy by the ocean currents and atmosphere, the tropics would be much hotter, and the polar regions much colder
