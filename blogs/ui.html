	<p id="first">We have been surviving in this world because of the generosity of our mother Earth. We have built our shelter, created our garments, and consumed foods from the bosom of our loving planet. But the most important question lies in our part of taking care of our mother Earth.	</p> <br> 

	<p id="first">What have we done for the well being of our planet? Have we played our roles dutifully?</p> <br>

	<p id="first">It is a matter of fact that our planet Earth is dying slowly. And we humans are the ones to be blamed for this tragic fact. But still, there is hope for us and for our world. And the name of hope is <strong>Jesus Christ.</strong> Only He can restore and heal our Earth.</p> <br>

	<p id="first">Now, what should we humans do? The answer is simple. Our duty is to take useful steps in healing our planet until He returns. And shouldn't be too hard, because, together, we all can move mountains with His grace.</p>
